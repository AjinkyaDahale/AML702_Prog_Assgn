This project was made in partial fulfilment of the course AML702 Applied Computational Mechanics, Semester II 2014-15. It is a small GTK app written in Python that demonstrates some common numerical integration methods viz. trapezoidal, Simpson's rules, and Gauss-Legendre Quadrature. 

Requirements:
* Python 3
* NumPy
* SciPy
* GTK+ (>=3.10)
* Glade 3.16 to open the gui file

The main code is in numintegrationdemo.py. Run it on python to begin the demo.
